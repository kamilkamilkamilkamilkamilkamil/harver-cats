to run
node main.ts

personal notes:

Problems with mapbox/blend instal.
Was mapbox/blend part of the challenge? lol

manually importing node-blend-master

npm permissions denied to install packages.

request is deprecated
Installing axios
axios takes care of promises for me.

Less is more, bundle sizing - fetch api would be preferred.

Removing try/catch from axios request in favour to moving it into promise.all for fast-fail purposes (if 1 in 10 requests fail, whole thing breaks)
